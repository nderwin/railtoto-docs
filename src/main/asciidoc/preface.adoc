== Preface

While working on plans for a model railroad based on the Nickel Plate Railroad in Indiana, I wanted to inject as much realism
as possible into the operations aspect.  Having multiple stations along the route, possibly setting signals indicating the
approaching train should stop for new orders, appealed to my desire to operate as realistically as possible.  Unfortunately, this
also meant a lot more "moving parts" - either I was going to have to wear a lot of hats and do a lot of paperwork, or I would have
to develop a cast of people to fulfill the multiple roles whenever I wanted to "play trains".

Naturally, being a software engineer, my thoughts turned towards a software solution.  I have been kicking around an idea for a
long time (since graduate school actually...  now where's that thesis I started...?) about using some form of events to trigger
actions on the railroad - customers calling for cars to load their goods, a random run-through passenger train, etc.  With the
development of things like the Raspberry Pi and Docker containers, the idea has started to take more concrete shape.  Instead of
one large piece of software with a lot of timers kicking off events, what if I could write individual pieces of software to simulate
communications from the dispatcher to train crews or stations along the line?

The first thing to do is to write some of this down and get serious about the system design...
