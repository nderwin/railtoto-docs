== The Organization

In order to model the internal communications that happen on the railroad, first we need to understand the organizational structure
so we can then model the lines of communication.  Below is a rough organization chart <<org>> I have been able to piece together 
from various sources.

There are many more people that could be included here, but the focus is on the principal people involved with the portion of the
railroad being modeled, namely the Indianapolis Division of the Lake Erie & Western District.  It is not quite clear what the 
exact hierarchy is for Assistant Train Masters, Chief Dispatchers, General Yardmasters, Yardmasters, Dispatchers, and Agents is,
as the organization chart I have for reference mentions all of these roles as reporting to a box containing the Assistant 
Superintendent and Train Masters.

There are multiple Agents <<loas>>, but it is unclear to whom they would report.  Finally, there are the other positions mentioned 
in the time-table <<tt31>>, but fitting them into the picture is difficult without definitive sources of information.

For the simulation, I will model the communication between two of the roles mentioned above - <<OPERATOR,Operator>> and 
<<DISPATCHER,Dispatcher>>.  Note that we don't see Operator mentioned, but it seems that these responsibilities were fulfilled by 
the Agent on this segment of the railroad.
